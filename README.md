# Hey There :wave:

This was my fourth project in REACT!.  VSTDA they call it("Very Simple To Do App").  Don't let the name fool you, this one was a douse, for me at least.  There were a lot of different components and methods I had to bring in from what I have learned thus far.  It really helped test my knowledge and learn how to mess with and pass state to different components.  There are still several things I want to do with this app, but for now its time to move on in the curriculum. :muscle:

To get started, open the app in VS code, or code editor of your choosing.  Install the necessary dependencies via the terminal by typing 'npm install'. Next, in the terminal, type 'node server/index.js' to start the app on the local node server. Open localhost:3000 in the browser of your choice.  

## ENJOY! :ok_hand:
